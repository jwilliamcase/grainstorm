We will fix two main issues:

1. **Identifier 'bufferLength' already declared**  
   - In `grainstormProcessor.js`, there is a duplicated `const bufferLength = ...` declaration. We'll remove the second one so that it doesn't cause a `SyntaxError`.

2. **Spray Slider Styling**  
   - In `style.css`, the spray slider isn’t included in the same rule as the other sliders, causing size mismatches. We'll add `#spraySlider` to the same selector.

After these fixes, the code should compile without the “already been declared” error, and the spray slider should match the other sliders’ width.  

Finally, regarding whether you’re on track for a browser-based granular delay effect:  
- You do have the core structure of a granular engine (grain scheduling, random position “spray,” pitch shifting, and windowing).  
- To function more like a traditional “delay,” you’d typically feed processed output back into the input to produce repeated echoes, or you’d hold audio in a circular buffer. Right now, your approach is reading from a single sample rather than a real-time input, but you can adapt it to capture audio or feed the output back in if desired.  
- You can also continue refining the envelope generation, randomization, and layering to get more “cloud-like” or “echo-like” textures.  

Below are the specific code changes.
